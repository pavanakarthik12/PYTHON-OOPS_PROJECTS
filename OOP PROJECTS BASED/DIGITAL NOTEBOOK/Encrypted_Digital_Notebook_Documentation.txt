# üóÇÔ∏è Encrypted Digital Notebook ‚Äì Python OOP Project

## üìå Overview

This project is a command-line-based **Digital Notebook** built using Python's **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It allows users to:

- Create categories of notes  
- Add, edit, view, and delete notes  
- Save/load encrypted notes using `.txt` files (Base64 encoding)  
- Interact with the notebook using a **menu system**  

It demonstrates key OOP concepts: **encapsulation**, **modularity**, **abstraction**, and **file handling** with **basic encryption**.

## üß± Classes and Structure

### ‚úÖ `Note` Class
Represents a single note with:
- `title`: Title of the note  
- `content`: Body text  
- `timestamp`: Date & time created/updated  

**Methods:**
- `view_note()`: Displays note details  
- `edit_note(new_content)`: Updates the note content and timestamp  
- `to_txt(category_name)`: Converts note to string for file storage  
- `from_txt(lines)`: Creates a `Note` object from stored lines  

---

### ‚úÖ `Category` Class
Groups related notes.

**Attributes:**
- `category_name`: Name of the category  
- `notes`: List of `Note` objects  

**Methods:**
- `add_note(note)`: Adds a note  
- `remove_note(title)`: Deletes a note by title  
- `list_notes()`: Displays all notes  
- `save_to_encrypted_txt(filename)`: Saves encrypted notes to `.txt`  
- `load_from_encrypted_txt(filename)`: Loads & decrypts notes from `.txt`  

---

## üîê Encryption
- All notes are **Base64-encoded** before saving
- This ensures the `.txt` file is not readable in plain text
- Decoding is handled automatically when loading

---

## üìñ Menu System

A menu-based UI for interacting with the notebook. Users can:

1. Create a new category  
2. Add a new note  
3. View all notes in a category  
4. Edit a note by title  
5. Delete a note  
6. Save notes to an encrypted `.txt` file  
7. Load notes from an encrypted `.txt` file  
8. List all `.txt` files in the current folder  
9. Exit the program  

---

## üìÇ File Storage Format

Each note is stored in the format (before encryption):

```
Category: Personal
Title: Shopping List
Content: Milk, Eggs, Bread
Timestamp: 2025-04-12T10:40:15.456789
---
```

Notes are stored line-by-line and encrypted with base64 before saving.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.  
2. Save the file as `notebook.py`  
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python notebook.py
   ```

---

## üß™ Sample Usage

```python
note1 = Note("Reminder", "Finish Python OOP project")
cat = Category("Work")
cat.add_note(note1)
cat.save_to_encrypted_txt("work_notes.txt")

# Later or in another run
cat2 = Category("Work")
cat2.load_from_encrypted_txt("work_notes.txt")
cat2.list_notes()
```

## üéì Educational Purpose

This project is ideal for:
- Practicing Python OOP
- Understanding file handling
- Learning how to encode/decode with base64
- Building menu-driven command-line tools
