# Smart Home Automation System - Documentation

## Introduction
This project is a **Smart Home Automation System** built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows users to control various smart devices such as **Lights, Fans, and Air Conditioners (ACs)** within a room. The project includes a **menu-driven interface** for easy interaction.

## Purpose
This project was developed as a **beginner-level OOP practice** to test concepts like **inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation**. It provides a structured way to manage smart home devices efficiently.

## Features
✅ **Device Management** – Supports different types of smart devices (Lights, Fans, ACs).  
✅ **Room-Based Organization** – Devices are grouped into rooms for efficient control.  
✅ **User Interaction** – Users can add devices, control them, and check status via a menu.  
✅ **Batch Control** – Turn all devices ON/OFF at once.  
✅ **Dynamic Properties** – Lights have brightness levels, Fans have speed levels, and ACs have temperature settings.

## Class Structure

### **1. Device (Base Class)**
- Attributes: `name`, `is_on`
- Methods:
  - `turn_on()`: Turns the device ON
  - `turn_off()`: Turns the device OFF
  - `get_status()`: Returns the device status

### **2. Light (Inherits from Device)**
- Additional Attribute: `brightness`
- Additional Method: `set_brightness()` (Sets brightness level)

### **3. Fan (Inherits from Device)**
- Additional Attribute: `fanspeed`
- Additional Method: `set_fan_speed()` (Sets fan speed level)

### **4. AC (Inherits from Device)**
- Additional Attribute: `temp`
- Additional Method: `set_temperature()` (Sets temperature level)

*5. Room Clasa
- Attributes: `name`, `devices` (list of devices in the room)
- Methods:
  - `add_device()`: Adds a device to the room
  - `control_all()`: Turns all devices ON/OFF
  - `get_status()`: Displays the status of all devices in the room

 **6. User Class
- Attribute: `name`
- Methods:
  - `control_device()`: Controls a specific device

## How to Use

### **1. Start the System**
Run the script, and the **menu interface** will appear.

### **2. Select a Room and User**
The system will prompt the user to enter a room name and a user name.

### **3. Use the Menu Options**
- `1️⃣ Add Light` – Add a new light to the room.
- `2️⃣ Add Fan` – Add a new fan to the room.
- `3️⃣ Add AC` – Add a new AC to the room.
- `4️⃣ Control All Devices` – Turn all devices ON/OFF.
- `5️⃣ Check Room Status` – View the status of all devices.
- `6️⃣ Exit` – Close the program.
